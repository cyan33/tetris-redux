This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.\n *\n *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks. This\n *    may be done in the worker thread.\n *\n *  - Forward these native events (with the associated top-level type used to\n *    trap it) to `EventPluginHub`, which in turn will ask plugins if they want\n *    to extract any synthetic events.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` will then process each event by annotating them with\n *    \"dispatches\", a sequence of listeners and IDs that care about that event.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` then dispatches the events.\n *\n * Overview of React and the event system:\n *\n * +------------+    .\n * |    DOM     |    .\n * +------------+    .\n *       |           .\n *       v           .\n * +------------+    .\n * | ReactEvent |    .\n * |  Listener  |    .\n * +------------+    .                         +-----------+\n *       |           .               +--------+|SimpleEvent|\n *       |           .               |         |Plugin     |\n * +-----|------+    .               v         +-----------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+                    +------------+\n * |     +-----------.--->|EventPluginHub|                    |    Event   |\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  | Propagators|\n * | ReactEvent |    .    |              |     |TapEvent   |  |------------|\n * |  Emitter   |    .    |              |<---+|Plugin     |  |other plugin|\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  |  utilities |\n * |     +-----------.--->|              |                    +------------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+\n * +-----|------+    .                ^        +-----------+\n *       |           .                |        |Enter/Leave|\n *       +           .                +-------+|Plugin     |\n * +-------------+   .                         +-----------+\n * | application |   .\n * |-------------|   .\n * |             |   .\n * |             |   .\n * +-------------+   .\n *                   .\n *    React Core     .
